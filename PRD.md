# SF Supernova – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Strategic Purpose & Commercial Rationale
Defines why SF Supernova exists as a business, the revenue-first motivations, and the link to the board-approved strategy.

### 1.1 Business Mission & Market Opportunity

**Mission Statement**

SF Supernova exists to transform the vast, chaotic landscape of public domain science fiction into a premium destination that serves both passionate enthusiasts and curious newcomers. We curate, enhance, and monetize the golden age of science fiction (1930s-1980s)—not by hoarding content, but by adding the value that archives cannot: expert curation, editorial quality, community, and structured pathways to discovery.

**The Market Problem**

While over 77,000 public domain science fiction texts exist across Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive, and scattered repositories, the market suffers from a quality paradox: abundance without accessibility. The existing landscape is characterized by:

- **Poor Quality Execution**: 10-30% OCR error rates rendering classic works nearly unreadable
- **Zero Curation**: Algorithmic dumps with no editorial guidance or context
- **Fragmented Discovery**: Content scattered across multiple archives with inconsistent metadata
- **Amateur Production Values**: LibriVox audiobooks rely on volunteer narration; visual galleries lack professional presentation
- **Missing Context**: No narrative connecting individual works to the broader evolution of the genre
- **Underserved Niches**: Female Golden Age authors, New Wave introductions, international translations, and obscure pulp masterpieces remain systematically under-digitized

**Market Opportunity**

The vintage science fiction audience represents a substantial, undermonetized segment:

- **Primary Audience**: 500K-2M active vintage sci-fi enthusiasts globally (English-speaking markets)
- **Search Volume**: 100K+ monthly searches for classic sci-fi titles, authors, and discovery queries
- **Demonstrated WTP**: Successful Patreon creators ($3-15/month tiers), thriving vintage book markets, premium audiobook subscriptions
- **TAM Validation**: Reddit communities (r/printSF: 180K members, r/RetroFuturism: 850K members), active Discord servers, robust YouTube channels covering vintage content

**Why Now?**

Three market catalysts converge to create exceptional timing:

1. **AI-Enabled Production**: Modern tooling enables correction of OCR errors, enhancement of digitization quality, and accelerated content production at 5-10x traditional rates
2. **Public Domain Expansion**: The 2019-2025 copyright cliff releases thousands of 1920s works annually, with 1928-1963 works entering based on renewal verification
3. **Discovery Gap**: Major platforms (Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive) have abandoned curation in favor of preservation, leaving the market desperate for expert guidance

**Our Competitive Moat**

Where existing players compete on volume and preservation, SF Supernova competes on:

- **Expert Curation**: Selective, contextualized presentation over algorithmic dumps
- **Production Quality**: Professional-grade text correction, audio production, visual presentation
- **Discovery Architecture**: Structured pathways connecting isolated works into coherent journeys
- **Revenue-Justified Investment**: Commercial model enabling sustainable quality improvements that volunteer archives cannot match

The content is free. Great curation, enhanced quality, and guided discovery are priceless—and monetizable.

### 1.2 Revenue-First Mandate

**Commercial Imperative**

SF Supernova is designed as a **revenue-generating business from inception**, not a passion project seeking eventual monetization. This revenue-first mandate is non-negotiable and drives every product, feature, and content decision. The platform exists to generate sustainable income while serving the vintage science fiction community—these objectives are complementary, not competing.

**Strategic Rationale for Revenue Priority**

Quality curation, enhanced production, and sustained operations require financial resources that volunteer efforts and archive models cannot provide. Revenue generation enables:

- **Sustainable Quality**: Professional OCR correction, audio production, editorial standards, and visual presentation require paid labor and tooling
- **Content Velocity**: AI-assisted production workflows, hosting infrastructure, and content management systems demand ongoing investment
- **Competitive Differentiation**: The ability to outpace free archives requires resources they structurally cannot access
- **Platform Evolution**: Development of discovery tools, membership systems, digital product engines, and structured data layers requires capital

Unlike public archives constrained by volunteer capacity and institutional inertia, SF Supernova's commercial model creates the sustainable infrastructure to deliver what the market demonstrably wants but cannot currently access.

**Revenue as Product Validation**

Revenue serves as the ultimate market signal. If users will not pay (directly or indirectly through attention/data), the product has failed to create sufficient value above free alternatives. Our revenue-first approach forces discipline:

- **Features must justify their existence commercially**: Does this drive traffic, conversions, retention, or referrals?
- **Content must attract or convert**: Does this piece support acquisition, engagement, or monetization?
- **User experience must facilitate revenue pathways**: Does this flow naturally guide free users toward paid value?

**Non-Negotiable Financial Principles**

1. **Every feature must have a revenue hypothesis**: How does this contribute to acquisition, conversion, retention, or economics?
2. **Content production must scale profitably**: Cost-to-produce must remain sustainable against revenue per piece
3. **Monetization cannot be deferred**: Revenue streams activate in Phase 1, not "eventually"
4. **Traffic without monetization is vanity**: Pageviews matter only insofar as they convert to revenue
5. **Free content serves commercial purpose**: Discovery layer exists to drive paid conversion, not as end unto itself

**Implications for Product Development**

This mandate directly shapes the product roadmap:

- **Phase 1 prioritizes Options 3 & 2**: Digital Product Engine and Membership System launch before enhanced discovery (Options 4 & 1) because they generate revenue immediately
- **Content selection favors commercial potential**: SEO-driven content calendar targets high-intent, convertible searches over pure passion projects
- **User experience optimizes conversion funnels**: Free → Product → Membership pathways are architected from day one, not retrofitted
- **Feature requests evaluated on ROI**: Community desires matter only when aligned with revenue contribution

**Transparency and Authenticity**

The revenue-first mandate does not require hiding commercial intent. SF Supernova's audience—collectors, enthusiasts, and serious fans—understands that quality curation and production require resources. Our positioning celebrates this: *"The content is free; great curation is worth paying for."*

We pursue revenue transparently, delivering genuine value at every tier rather than extracting value through dark patterns or deceptive tactics. Sustainable business and community trust are compatible when value exchange is honest and equitable.


### 1.3 Board-Approved Strategy & Investment Thesis

**Strategic Framework**

The board has approved a phased development strategy structured around five discrete options, sequenced to prioritize immediate revenue generation while building toward sustainable competitive advantage. This approach balances commercial urgency with technical feasibility, validating revenue streams before expanding infrastructure.

**Approved Option Sequence**

The board-approved roadmap follows this priority order:

**Phase 1 (Months 0-6): Revenue Foundation**
- **Option 3 - Digital Product Engine**: Direct monetization through curated ebooks, enhanced editions, and audio collections
- **Option 2 - Membership System**: Recurring revenue through tiered subscriptions offering exclusive content, ad-free experience, and community access

**Phase 2 (Months 6-12): Discovery & Engagement**
- **Option 4 - Structured Data & Graph Layer**: Enhanced metadata, relationship mapping, and intelligent recommendations
- **Option 1 - Discovery & Navigation Engine**: Improved content browsing, search functionality, and user pathways

**Phase 3 (Months 12-18): Market Expansion**
- **Option 5 - Advanced Features & Premium Tools**: Analytics dashboards, collection management, and power-user functionality

**Investment Thesis**

The board's approval rests on four core investment principles:

**1. Revenue Before Infrastructure**

Traditional product development invests heavily in discovery and user experience before monetization. SF Supernova inverts this:

- **Immediate monetization validates market demand**: If users won't pay for curated products and membership, enhanced discovery won't save the business
- **Revenue funds infrastructure development**: Phase 1 earnings directly finance Phase 2 capabilities
- **Early cash flow reduces risk**: Positive unit economics established in months 1-6, not year 2-3

This sequencing means the platform may launch with "good enough" discovery tools while offering premium products—deliberately prioritizing commercial validation over feature completeness.

**2. Asset-Light, High-Margin Model**

The public domain content strategy enables exceptional unit economics:

- **Zero content acquisition costs**: Pre-1928 works are legally free; 1928-1963 works require only renewal verification
- **AI-amplified production**: Content enhancement (OCR correction, audio production, editorial curation) achieves 5-10x efficiency vs. traditional methods
- **Digital distribution**: No inventory, fulfillment, or physical logistics costs
- **Scalable infrastructure**: Cloud hosting scales with revenue; marginal cost per user approaches zero

**Projected Contribution Margins:**
- Digital products: 85-92% (after payment processing, hosting, minimal production costs)
- Membership tiers: 88-94% (after platform fees, hosting)
- Affiliate commissions: 95-98% (pure margin on third-party sales)
- Art/Merchandise: 60-75% (print-on-demand models)

**3. Defensible Moat Through Execution, Not Exclusivity**

Since content itself cannot be monopolized (it's public domain), competitive advantage derives from:

- **Curation Expertise**: Editorial judgment and contextual knowledge that algorithms cannot replicate
- **Production Quality**: Professional-grade enhancement that volunteer efforts structurally cannot match
- **Data Network Effects**: Structured metadata, user behavior insights, and recommendation intelligence improve with scale
- **Community Lock-In**: Membership communities, user-generated content, and social features create switching costs

Competitors can access the same raw content but cannot easily replicate the value-added layer we build atop it.

**4. Capital Efficiency & Bootstrapped Growth**

The approved strategy requires minimal external capital:

- **Self-funded Phase 1**: Founder resources sufficient for initial product launch and membership system
- **Revenue-funded Phase 2**: Phase 1 cash flow finances discovery infrastructure
- **Optionality for acceleration**: If Phase 1 exceeds projections, external capital could compress timeline; if underperforms, bootstrap continues at sustainable pace

This approach preserves founder equity while validating product-market fit before significant capital deployment.

**Commercial Success Criteria**

The board has established clear go/no-go triggers for phase progression:

**Phase 1 → Phase 2 Trigger:**
- Minimum 100 paying customers (products or membership) within 6 months
- Positive contribution margin (revenue > direct costs)
- Demonstrated organic traffic growth (10K+ monthly visitors)

**Phase 2 → Phase 3 Trigger:**
- $3,000+ monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- 500+ email subscribers
- Proven conversion funnel (traffic → email → customer at >2% composite rate)

**Pivot/Terminate Criteria:**
- Failure to achieve 50 paying customers by month 9 signals fundamental product-market fit failure
- Negative unit economics after 12 months indicates unsustainable cost structure
- Inability to generate organic traffic suggests SEO/content strategy failure

**Strategic Flexibility**

While the option sequence is approved, the board recognizes market feedback may necessitate tactical adjustments:

- If membership significantly outperforms digital products, accelerate community features
- If affiliate revenue exceeds projections, expand content targeting commercial-intent searches
- If discovery limitations materially harm conversion, advance Option 1 implementation

The strategy is directionally locked but executionally flexible, prioritizing commercial outcomes over rigid adherence to sequence.

### 1.4 Commercial Objectives & Success Criteria

**Primary Commercial Objective**

Achieve sustainable profitability within 18 months, defined as consistent monthly revenue exceeding $3,000 with positive cash flow and demonstrated path to $5,000+ MRR by month 24. This objective prioritizes business viability over growth-at-all-costs, establishing SF Supernova as a sustainable income-generating asset rather than a speculative venture requiring continuous capital infusion.

**Revenue Targets by Phase**

**Phase 1 (Months 0-6): Revenue Ignition**
- **Month 3 Target**: First $500 in cumulative revenue (validation of willingness-to-pay)
- **Month 6 Target**: $800-1,500 MRR (digital products + membership combined)
- **Success Metric**: 100+ paying customers acquired across all revenue streams

**Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Revenue Acceleration**
- **Month 9 Target**: $2,000-3,000 MRR (proving scalability beyond early adopters)
- **Month 12 Target**: $3,500-5,000 MRR (approaching sustainability threshold)
- **Success Metric**: 300+ active customers with <10% monthly churn

**Phase 3 (Months 13-18): Revenue Maturation**
- **Month 15 Target**: $4,500-6,500 MRR (consistent profitability)
- **Month 18 Target**: $6,000-8,000 MRR (clear path to full-time viability)
- **Success Metric**: 500+ active customers, multiple revenue streams contributing >15% each

**Revenue Mix Objectives**

Diversified revenue protects against single-channel dependency and platform risk:

**Target Revenue Mix (Month 18):**
- Digital Products: 30-40% (ebooks, audio collections, enhanced editions)
- Membership Tiers: 35-45% (recurring subscriptions, community access)
- Affiliate Commissions: 10-20% (book sales, related products)
- Art/Merchandise: 5-10% (prints, posters, physical goods)
- Premium Tools (future): 0-5% (Phase 3+ dashboards, analytics)

**No single revenue stream should exceed 50% of total revenue by month 18**, ensuring resilience against algorithm changes, platform policy shifts, or market disruptions.

**Unit Economics Targets**

Sustainable growth requires positive unit economics at the customer level:

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
- Target: <$5 per customer (primarily organic/SEO, minimal paid acquisition)
- Maximum acceptable: $15 per customer (only if LTV supports 3:1 ratio)
- Strategy: Organic content marketing, SEO, community building, word-of-mouth

**Lifetime Value (LTV):**
- Digital Product Buyers: $25-45 average (single or multiple purchase behavior)
- Membership (Monthly): $120-180 (assumes 6-12 month average retention)
- Membership (Annual): $180-240 (assumes 2-3 year average retention with renewals)
- Blended LTV Target: $60+ across all customer types

**LTV:CAC Ratio Target: >8:1** (exceptional for content businesses, achievable through organic acquisition)

**Traffic & Engagement Objectives**

Revenue derives from traffic quality and conversion efficiency, not raw volume:

**Traffic Targets:**
- Month 6: 15,000-30,000 monthly pageviews
- Month 12: 50,000-80,000 monthly pageviews
- Month 18: 100,000-150,000 monthly pageviews

**Conversion Targets:**
- Visitor → Email Subscriber: 3-5%
- Email Subscriber → First Purchase: 8-12%
- First Purchase → Repeat Customer: 25-35%
- Free User → Member: 1-2% (direct conversion)
- Product Buyer → Member Upgrade: 15-25%

**Engagement Quality Metrics:**
- Average Session Duration: >3 minutes (indicates genuine interest vs. bounces)
- Pages per Session: >2.5 (exploring beyond entry page)
- Return Visitor Rate: >30% (building habit and loyalty)
- Email Open Rate: >35% (list quality and content relevance)
- Email Click-Through Rate: >8% (driving action, not passive reading)

**Content Production Efficiency**

Sustainable operations require balancing content velocity with cost discipline:

**Production Targets:**
- Articles Published: 5-10 per week (260-520 annually)
- Average Cost-to-Produce: <$15 per article (including AI tools, editing time, hosting)
- Revenue per Article (12-month trailing): >$50 (SEO value, affiliate conversions, traffic contribution)
- Content ROI: >3:1 (revenue generated per dollar invested in production)

**Digital Product Targets:**
- New Products Released: 2-4 per month minimum (maintaining catalog freshness)
- Average Production Cost: <$100 per product (OCR correction, editing, formatting, cover design)
- Average Product Revenue (first 90 days): >$300 (justifying production investment)
- Product Catalog Size: 50+ SKUs by month 12, 100+ by month 18

**Operational Efficiency Targets**

Profitability requires cost discipline across all operational dimensions:

**Infrastructure Costs:**
- Hosting & CDN: <$100/month (scalable cloud architecture)
- AI & Production Tools: <$200/month (Claude API, design tools, OCR services)
- Payment Processing: <3% of revenue (Stripe/PayPal standard rates)
- Email Marketing: <$50/month (Mailchimp/ConvertKit at current scale)
- **Total Fixed Costs Target: <$500/month by month 12**

**Labor Economics:**
- Founder Time Investment: 15-25 hours/week (sustainable alongside other projects)
- Revenue per Hour Target: >$50/hour by month 12, >$100/hour by month 18
- Contractor/Freelance: <15% of revenue (audio narration, specialized design)

**Success Validation Milestones**

Clear binary indicators determine whether SF Supernova is achieving its commercial mandate:

**Month 3 Validation:**
- ✓ First paying customer acquired
- ✓ Product catalog >10 SKUs
- ✓ Email list >100 subscribers
- ✓ Organic traffic >5,000 monthly pageviews

**Month 6 Go/No-Go:**
- ✓ 100+ paying customers (cumulative)
- ✓ $800+ MRR
- ✓ Positive contribution margin
- ✓ Organic traffic >15,000 monthly pageviews
- ✗ **Failure to achieve = strategic reassessment required**

**Month 12 Sustainability Check:**
- ✓ $3,000+ MRR
- ✓ 300+ active customers
- ✓ <10% monthly churn
- ✓ Multiple revenue streams >15% each
- ✓ LTV:CAC ratio >5:1
- ✗ **Failure to achieve = potential pivot or wind-down**

**Month 18 Viability Confirmation:**
- ✓ $6,000+ MRR
- ✓ 500+ active customers
- ✓ Positive cash flow (revenue > all costs)
- ✓ Proven acquisition channels scaling
- ✓ Product-market fit validated across segments
- ✗ **Failure to achieve = re-evaluate fundamental business model**

**Strategic vs. Vanity Metrics**

SF Supernova explicitly rejects vanity metrics that do not correlate with commercial success:

**We do NOT optimize for:**
- Social media followers (unless converting to email/customers)
- Pageviews without conversion intent
- Email list size without engagement/monetization
- Content volume without revenue contribution
- Awards, recognition, or industry accolades

**We DO optimize for:**
- Revenue per customer
- Customer lifetime value
- Conversion rates across funnel
- Repeat purchase behavior
- Organic traffic with commercial intent
- Cost efficiency and profitability

**Accountability & Reporting Cadence**

Commercial objectives require disciplined measurement and transparent accountability:

- **Weekly**: Traffic, conversion, revenue dashboards reviewed
- **Monthly**: Full P&L, customer cohort analysis, funnel performance assessment
- **Quarterly**: Strategic review against phase objectives, go/no-go decision evaluation
- **Board Review**: Formal performance assessment at 6, 12, 18-month milestones

All metrics tracked in centralized dashboard, automated where possible, with clear owner accountability for each KPI.

**Failure Modes & Exit Criteria**

Honest commercial management requires defining failure explicitly:

**Terminate/Pivot if:**
- Revenue <$1,500 MRR by month 12 (insufficient market demand)
- LTV:CAC ratio <2:1 by month 12 (unsustainable economics)
- Unable to achieve organic traffic growth (SEO strategy failure)
- Churn >15% monthly (product-market fit failure)
- Founder burnout or time investment >40 hours/week sustained (lifestyle unsustainability)

The revenue-first mandate demands intellectual honesty: SF Supernova must prove commercial viability or be wound down in favor of opportunities with superior risk-adjusted returns.
