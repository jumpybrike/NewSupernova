## Executive Summary

### Purpose & Scope

### Key Architectural Principles

---

## 1. Site Structure Overview

### 1.1 Information Hierarchy

#### 1.1.1 Level 0: Homepage

The homepage serves as the primary entry point and value demonstration layer, designed to immediately establish credibility and guide users toward their intent (browse, search, or discover). Key components include hero messaging ("Discover the overlooked masterpieces of golden age sci-fi"), featured content carousels (recent articles, new releases, curated collections), and clear navigation pathways to core site sections. The homepage must achieve bounce rate <60% and communicate SF Supernova's unique value proposition within 5 seconds of landing. End

#### 1.1.2 Level 1: Primary Navigation Categories

Primary navigation consists of five core sections accessible from global header: **Discover** (browse by era, theme, author, format), **Library** (digital product catalog with ebooks and audiobooks), **Articles** (editorial content, reviews, author profiles), **Membership** (tier comparison and benefits), and **About** (mission, founder story, contact). Each primary category serves distinct user intents—Discover supports exploration, Library enables commerce, Articles builds trust through content, Membership drives recurring revenue, and About establishes authenticity. Maximum 3 clicks required from homepage to any content or product detail page.

#### 1.1.3 Level 2: Sub-Categories & Browse Pages

Sub-categories provide faceted navigation within primary sections: Discover includes Era pages (1920s-1980s by decade), Theme pages (30+ categories like Time Travel, Space Opera, Dystopia), Author Directory (alphabetical with filters), and Format pages (novels, short stories, radio dramas). Library divides into Ebooks, Audiobooks, Collections/Bundles, and New Releases, each with sorting and filtering capabilities. Articles segment into Reviews, Author Profiles, Historical Context, and Curated Lists. All browse pages feature consistent filtering UI, clear breadcrumbs, and related content recommendations.

#### 1.1.4 Level 3: Content Detail Pages

Detail pages represent final destination for user intent fulfillment with four primary templates: **Work/Book Detail** (product pages with description, metadata, purchase/download CTA, samples, and related works), **Article Detail** (editorial content with reading time, author byline, social sharing, and email capture), **Author Profile** (biography, bibliography, influence relationships, and available products), and **Collection/Bundle** (curated sets with value proposition, included works, and purchase options). Each template optimizes for both user engagement (discovery, reading) and conversion (email capture, purchase, membership signup).

#### 1.1.5 Level 4: Utility & Support Pages

Utility pages support user account management, commerce, and legal compliance: **Account Dashboard** (membership status, purchase history, credits, settings), **Checkout Flow** (cart, payment, confirmation), **Member Content** (exclusive articles, benefits overview), **Search Results** (unified search across all content types), and **Legal/Support** (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Refund Policy, Contact/FAQ). These pages prioritize functionality over discovery, with minimal distraction and clear task-completion pathways. Member dashboard provides self-service for subscription management to minimize support overhead.
