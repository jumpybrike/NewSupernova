# The Cartographer: Colour Palette Specification

**SF Supernova Design System v1.0**

---

## Introduction

The Cartographer is the definitive colour palette for SF Supernova, a curated digital library of vintage science fiction. Named for the navigators who charted unknown waters and skies, this palette embodies the synthesis of precision and wonder—brass sextants measuring the distance to worlds that never were, aged star charts plotting courses through literary imagination.

The system is built on two primary colour families: Deep Teal and Amber. Deep Teal provides authority, depth, and the cool precision of scientific instruments. Amber provides warmth, illumination, and the glow of discovery. These are unified by warm paper surfaces that never touch pure white, and umber-shifted neutrals that carry the warmth of aged books.

Every colour in this system has been selected to feel at home in a scholar's library—sophisticated without being cold, warm without being saccharine, authoritative without being oppressive.

---

## Core Palette

The Cartographer is defined by five foundational colours from which all other values derive:

**Star Chart** (#F4F1E8) serves as the primary light background. This warm off-white has the character of aged paper without appearing yellowed or damaged. It provides a comfortable reading surface that reduces eye strain compared to pure white.

**Vellum** (#E8E3D6) functions as the secondary surface colour for cards, elevated elements, and subtle differentiation. It sits one step darker than Star Chart while maintaining the same warm undertone.

**Deep Teal** (#1A4A4A) is the primary brand colour. This rich, saturated teal carries the depth of ocean water and the authority of a captain's uniform. It serves as the dominant action colour for buttons, links, and primary interactive elements.

**Amber** (#C9943A) is the warm accent colour. Used sparingly, Amber draws attention to featured content, highlights, and moments of particular importance. It represents the brass of navigational instruments and the warm glow of lamplight on mahogany.

**Night Sky** (#1A3535) is the primary text colour and dark UI surface. Warmer than pure black, it provides excellent contrast against light surfaces while maintaining the palette's overall warmth.

---

## Deep Teal Scale

The Deep Teal family provides a complete range from near-black depths to pale tints. This scale enables nuanced UI design while maintaining colour harmony.

**Teal 900** (#0A2424) is the deepest value, approaching black but retaining teal character. Use for dark mode backgrounds or maximum contrast situations.

**Teal 800** (#0F3333) serves as the primary dark mode surface or hero section backgrounds. It provides depth without the flatness of pure black.

**Teal 700** (#153D3D) works for hover states on dark surfaces and secondary dark UI elements.

**Teal 600** (#1A4A4A) is the primary brand teal. This is the default for buttons, links, and primary actions. All other teal values relate to this anchor.

**Teal 500** (#236060) provides a slightly lighter option for secondary buttons or less prominent actions.

**Teal 400** (#2D7A7A) is used for links on dark backgrounds and icon colours.

**Teal 300** (#4A9999) serves as text colour on dark surfaces and subtle accents.

**Teal 200** (#7DBDBD) works for muted text on dark backgrounds and decorative elements.

**Teal 100** (#B8DADA) provides subtle borders and dividers on light surfaces.

**Teal 50** (#E5F2F2) is the palest tint, used for tag backgrounds, subtle highlights, and hover states on light surfaces.

---

## Amber Scale

The Amber family provides warm accents across the full tonal range. Amber should be used more sparingly than Teal—it draws attention and should be reserved for moments of importance.

**Amber 900** (#5C3A10) is the deepest amber, approaching burnt sienna. Use for text on amber backgrounds or deep shadows in illustrations.

**Amber 800** (#7A4D15) provides dark amber for high-contrast text on light amber surfaces.

**Amber 700** (#9A6520) works for pressed button states and dark accents.

**Amber 600** (#B8802E) creates rich amber for gradient endpoints and secondary accents.

**Amber 500** (#C9943A) is the primary amber. This is the default for featured elements, accent buttons, and highlights. All other amber values relate to this anchor.

**Amber 400** (#D9A854) provides lighter amber for hover states and softer accents.

**Amber 300** (#E5BC70) serves as text on dark backgrounds when warmth is needed.

**Amber 200** (#F0D49E) works for pale highlights and warm decorative elements.

**Amber 100** (#F8E8C8) provides warm background tints for featured sections.

**Amber 50** (#FDF6EB) is the palest amber tint, used for subtle warm backgrounds on featured cards or callouts.

---

## Surface Colours

Surface colours define the backgrounds and containers throughout the interface. These are never pure white—they always carry the warmth of aged paper.

**Surface 0** (#FFFFFF) is pure white. It exists in the system for technical reasons but should rarely be used. When absolute white is required for contrast or specific UI patterns, it is available.

**Surface 50** (#FDFCF9) is warm white, the brightest practical background. Use for maximum brightness while maintaining palette warmth.

**Surface 100** (#F9F6F0) is the primary light mode background, slightly warmer than Surface 50.

**Surface 200** (#F4F1E8) is Star Chart, the default page background. Most content will sit on this surface.

**Surface 300** (#E8E3D6) is Vellum, used for cards and elevated surfaces sitting above Surface 200.

**Surface 400** (#DDD5C4) provides visible borders and heavier dividers.

**Surface 500** (#C9BFA8) is the darkest surface value, used for strong borders or disabled surface states.

---

## Neutral Scale

Neutrals provide the typographic and UI grey scale. Unlike standard grey scales, these neutrals carry a warm, umber undertone that harmonises with the paper surfaces and prevents the coldness of blue-greys.

**Neutral 900** (#1A2020) is the darkest neutral, used for primary text and headings on light backgrounds.

**Neutral 800** (#262D2D) serves for strong headings and high-emphasis text.

**Neutral 700** (#364040) provides secondary headings and labels.

**Neutral 600** (#4D5858) is the primary body text colour for extended reading.

**Neutral 500** (#667272) works for muted text, captions, and metadata.

**Neutral 400** (#8A9494) provides tertiary text and disabled states.

**Neutral 300** (#A8B0B0) creates visible borders and separators.

**Neutral 200** (#C5CBCB) is used for subtle dividers and input borders.

**Neutral 100** (#E0E4E4) provides very subtle borders and background differentiation.

**Neutral 50** (#F2F4F4) is the palest neutral, for subtle striping or minimal differentiation.

## Semantic Colours

Semantic colours communicate system states. These have been warmed to feel natural within The Cartographer palette rather than appearing as jarring intrusions.

### Success

Success indicates completion, validity, and healthy states. The green has been warmed to complement the palette.

- Background: #ECF7F2
- Border: #A8DCBE
- Text: #1A5C38

### Warning

Warning indicates caution or attention needed. It draws from the amber family to feel native to the palette.

- Background: #FDF8EB
- Border: #F0D49E
- Text: #7A4D15

### Error

Error indicates failure, invalidity, or blocked actions. The red has been softened and warmed.

- Background: #FDF2F2
- Border: #F0B8B8
- Text: #8B2020

---

## Filigree Colours

Filigree colours are decorative only. They represent the brass detailing of navigational instruments—used for ornamental borders, decorative rules, and document embellishment. They must never be used for interactive elements or semantic states.

**Filigree 50** (#FDF8EB) provides subtle warm backgrounds for decorative sections.

**Filigree 100** (#F8ECD0) creates decorative borders and gentle rules.

**Filigree 200** (#E5C87A) is used for ornamental dividers and gilt-style accents.

**Filigree 300** (#C9943A) provides the richest decorative accent, matching primary Amber.

---

## Export Colours

Export colours are optimised for print and PDF reproduction. They have been tested for fidelity across different printing conditions.

**Export Teal** (#1A4A4A) is the print-safe primary for headings and key markers.

**Export Amber** (#B8802E) is the print-safe accent, slightly deeper for better reproduction.

**Export Text Primary** (#1A2020) is the primary body text for printed materials.

**Export Text Secondary** (#4D5858) is used for captions, metadata, and secondary information.

          800: '#262D2D',
          900: '#1A2020',
        },
        success: {
          bg: '#ECF7F2',
          border: '#A8DCBE',
          text: '#1A5C38',
        },
        warning: {
          bg: '#FDF8EB',
          border: '#F0D49E',
          text: '#7A4D15',
        },
        error: {
          bg: '#FDF2F2',
          border: '#F0B8B8',
          text: '#8B2020',
        },
        filigree: {
          50: '#FDF8EB',
          100: '#F8ECD0',
          200: '#E5C87A',
          300: '#C9943A',
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Semantic Aliases

For clearer code, consider adding semantic aliases:

```javascript
// Additional semantic mappings
colors: {
  // Primary actions
  primary: '#1A4A4A',        // teal-600
  'primary-hover': '#153D3D', // teal-700
  
  // Accent actions  
  accent: '#C9943A',          // amber-500
  'accent-hover': '#D9A854',  // amber-400
  
  // Backgrounds
  'bg-primary': '#F4F1E8',    // surface-200 (Star Chart)
  'bg-elevated': '#E8E3D6',   // surface-300 (Vellum)
  'bg-dark': '#0F3333',       // teal-800
  
  // Text
  'text-primary': '#1A2020',  // neutral-900
  'text-secondary': '#4D5858', // neutral-600
  'text-muted': '#667272',    // neutral-500
  'text-on-dark': '#F4F1E8',  // surface-200
}
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Button Hierarchy

**Primary buttons** use Deep Teal (#1A4A4A) with Star Chart (#F4F1E8) text. Hover state darkens to Teal 700 (#153D3D).

**Accent buttons** use Amber (#C9943A) with Night Sky (#1A3535) text. Use sparingly for featured actions only.

**Secondary buttons** use a Teal outline with transparent background. They should not compete with primary buttons.

**Ghost buttons** use an Amber-tinted border with transparent background. Suitable for tertiary actions.

### Typography

Body text should use Neutral 600 (#4D5858) on Surface 200 (#F4F1E8) for comfortable extended reading.

Headings should use Neutral 900 (#1A2020) or Deep Teal (#1A4A4A) depending on emphasis required.

Text on dark backgrounds should use Surface 200 (#F4F1E8) or Teal 200 (#7DBDBD) depending on hierarchy.

### Dark Surfaces

When using dark surfaces (Teal 800 or Teal 900), pair with Amber accents for warmth. Text should be Surface 200 for primary content, Teal 200 for secondary content.

### Decorative Elements

Filigree colours are strictly decorative. Use for ornamental borders, chapter dividers, or document embellishment. Never use for buttons, status indicators, or interactive elements.

---

## Accessibility Notes

All primary colour pairings meet WCAG AA contrast requirements:

- Neutral 900 on Surface 200: 12.4:1 (AAA)
- Neutral 600 on Surface 200: 6.8:1 (AA)
- Deep Teal on Surface 200: 7.2:1 (AAA)
- Surface 200 on Teal 800: 10.1:1 (AAA)
- Amber 500 on Teal 900: 6.4:1 (AA)

When using Amber as a text colour, ensure sufficient contrast with the background. Amber on white or light surfaces may not meet accessibility requirements for body text—reserve it for large headings or decorative use.
