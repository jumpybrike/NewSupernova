# Three Optimal Research Directives for SF Supernova

Given your priority is **revenue maximization** with a **hybrid monetization model** targeting a **niche audience**, here are the three research activities that will give you the most actionable intelligence:

---

## Research Directive #1: Competitive Traffic & Monetization Analysis

**Objective**: Understand how similar sites actually make money and what traffic levels they achieve.

**Research Questions**:
- Which vintage/retro sci-fi sites exist and what's their traffic volume? (Use SimilarWeb, Ahrefs, or SEMrush)
- What monetization methods are they using? (Ads visible? Affiliate links? Premium tiers? Merch?)
- What content types drive their most traffic? (Reviews? Downloads? Galleries? Forums?)
- What are their top-performing pages/content? (Via SEMrush or Ahrefs keyword analysis)
- Which sites have failed or gone dormant, and why? (Wayback Machine research)
- What's the realistic ad RPM (revenue per 1000 pageviews) for vintage sci-fi content?
- What affiliate programs are most relevant? (Amazon Associates rates, Bookshop.org, other book sellers)

**Sites to analyze**:
- Project Gutenberg (traffic sources, user behavior)
- Vintage sci-fi blogs with significant followings
- Internet Archive's sci-fi sections (user patterns)
- Goodreads sci-fi groups (community engagement)
- Any sites selling vintage sci-fi merch or running premium tiers

**Actionable Output**: 
- Realistic revenue projections based on traffic benchmarks
- Identification of content gaps/opportunities competitors aren't filling
- Monetization model validation (or pivot recommendations)

## Research Directive #2: Audience Discovery & Intent Mapping

**Objective**: Find where your audience already congregates and what they're actually searching for.

**Research Questions**:
- Where do vintage sci-fi fans gather online? (Reddit subs, Facebook groups, Discord servers, forums)
- What questions are they asking? (Reddit threads, Quora, niche forums)
- What are they searching for? (Google Keyword Planner, AnswerThePublic, Reddit search trends)
- What content do they share/engage with most? (Social media analysis, Reddit upvotes)
- What problems do they complain about? (Accessibility, discovery, quality, community needs)
- What are they willing to pay for? (Existing products, Patreon supporters, Kickstarter backers for related projects)
- Who are the influencers/tastemakers in this space? (YouTubers, podcasters, bloggers, subreddit mods)

**Specific searches to conduct**:
- Long-tail SEO opportunities: "best 1950s science fiction novels," "where to find old sci-fi radio shows," "vintage sci-fi book covers"
- Reddit deep-dive: r/printSF, r/RetroFuturism, r/ClassicSciFi, r/OldSchoolCool, r/ObscureMedia
- YouTube: What vintage sci-fi content gets views? Book reviews? Cover art showcases? Audio drama uploads?
- Pinterest: What retro sci-fi imagery gets saved/shared?

**Actionable Output**:
- SEO content calendar targeting high-volume, low-competition keywords
- Community partnership opportunities
- Content format validation (do people want what you're planning to create?)
- Email signup incentive ideas based on actual audience pain points

## Research Directive #3: Public Domain Content Audit & Competitive Advantage Analysis

**Objective**: Map the full scope of copyright-free content available and identify your unique curation angle.

**Research Questions**:
- What pre-1928 sci-fi is actually available and WHERE? (Project Gutenberg, Internet Archive, LibriVox, Wikisource)
- What's the quality/format of existing digitizations? (OCR errors? Audio quality? Missing works?)
- What copyright-free content is NOT readily accessible but could be? (Obscure pulps, international works, audio dramas)
- What's the overlap between "available" and "actually good/important"? (Quality vs. quantity)
- What 1928-1980s content can you legally review/discuss without copyright issues?
- What cover art is demonstrably public domain or usable?
- What have competitors NOT digitized/curated that you could?

**Specific inventories to create**:
- Top 100 pre-1928 sci-fi works by cultural importance
- Gap analysis: Important works NOT well-represented in existing archives
- Audio drama inventory: What's available vs. what's wanted
- Cover art goldmine: Public domain pulp covers that are visually stunning

**Additional angle**:
- Research international public domain variations (some countries have different copyright terms)
- Investigate estates/publishers who've released works into Creative Commons

**Actionable Output**:
- Complete launch inventory: Exactly what content you can offer Day 1
- Differentiation strategy: What makes your archive/curation uniquely valuable
- Content roadmap: Prioritized list of materials to digitize/curate
- Legal confidence: Clear boundaries on what you can/cannot offer
